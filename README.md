# Course: INF367 25H / Selected Topics in Artificial Intelligence

This repository hosts resources that I created for the course [INF367 25H - Selected Topics in Artificial Intelligence](https://www4.uib.no/studier/emner/inf367?start_semester=2025H), that I designed and instructed in the Fall 2025 semester at University of Bergen.



## Summary

This semester, the course is (humbly) titled *Diamonds and Rust in the AI Treasure Chest*. As the title suggests, it often seems that the best way to describe (the whole field of) AI is "you who are so good with words", but at times it actually is or has been more like "[you] with brown leaves falling all around."


## Learning outcomes

The course aims to make the student able to:

- describe the methods presented during the course, and
- discuss the pros and/or cons of a given method with respect to other method and/or within a hypothetical scenario where the method could be applied.


## Materials

The first part of the course will be based on the book *Why machines learn: The elegant math behind modern AI*, by Anil Ananthaswamy (2024).

The slides used to present the topics in the lectures are in the directory `slides/`.


## Outline

- Lectures will be early on Mondays and late on Fridays.
- The type of assessment will be oral examination.
- There will be two mandatory assignments.
- We will follow a book for each major part of the course.
- The major parts will cover these topics:
  - Milestones in the history of AI techniques towards deep learning paradigm, and
  - Modern natural language processing,
  - with few other very recent topics like AI explainability and safety.


## Student Work

Additionally to the regular expected workload for attending lectures and studying asynchronously, the students are engaged with the course via these practical instances:

- **Activities** to be solved (and afterwords, explained by the instructor) during the lectures, to allow for breaks during each class as well as mainly to stimulate introspection and comprehension of the topics recently presented.
- A mandatory, **individual, written assignment**, where the student revisits part of the concepts already described in the course, through the lens of a new concept to be researched about. 
  - In this way, it also connects with topics that will be discussed and expanded in later lectures, by taking the student investigations to be delivered here as starting grounds which to build the lectures upon.
  - The student reports back by delivering an essay of 400-800 words where explains and reflects about it in relation to known and unkown related concepts. 
  - The student addresses several discussion points, on each having more degrees of choice about which adjacent concept to talk about.
- A mandatory, **team-based, oral assignment**, where the students in small teams read and reflect a research or divulgation article and presents it to the rest of the class, from where discussions are triggered among peers, and a final discussion closes the session. The  presentations are grouped in three thematic sessions, one per class:
  - A session about whether Large Language Models (LLMs) are liars, deceitful, believable, and other related categorizations;
  - A session about AI hype and fear across several application domains;
  - And a session about a topic around reasoning in LLMs that triggered the appearance of several response articles in the research community.
